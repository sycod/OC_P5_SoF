      "<p>My team has encountered a deadlock that I suspect is a bug in the Windows implementation of SRW locks. The code below is a distilled version of real code. Here's the summary:</p>\n",
      "<ol>\n",
      "<li>Main thread acquires exclusive lock</li>\n",
      "<li>Main thread creates N children threads</li>\n",
      "<li>Each child thread\n",
      "<ol>\n",
      "<li>Acquires a shared lock</li>\n",
      "<li>Spins until all children have acquired a shared lock</li>\n",
      "<li>Releases the shared lock</li>\n",
      "</ol>\n",
      "</li>\n",
      "<li>Main thread releases exclusive lock</li>\n",
      "</ol>\n",
      "<p>Yes this could be done with std::latch in C++20. That's not the point.</p>\n",
      "<p>This code works <em>most</em> of the time. However roughly 1 in 5000 loops it deadlocks. When it deadlocks exactly 1 child successfully acquires a shared lock and N-1 children are stuck in <code>lock_shared()</code>. On Windows this function calls into <code>RtlAcquireSRWLockShared</code> and blocks in <code>NtWaitForAlertByThreadId</code>.</p>\n",
      "<p>The behavior is observed when used <code>std::shared_mutex</code> directly, <code>std::shared_lock</code>/<code>std::unique_lock</code>, or simply calling <code>SRW</code> functions directly.</p>\n",
      "<p>A <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20170301-00/?p=95615\" rel=\"noreferrer\">2017 Raymond Chen post</a> asks about this exact behavior, but user error is blamed.</p>\n",
      "<p>This looks like an SRW bug to me. It's maybe worth noting that if a child doesn't attempt to latch and calls <code>unlock_shared</code> that this will wake its blocked siblings. There is nothing in the documentation for <code>std::shared_lock</code> or <code>*SRW*</code> that suggests is allowed to block even when there is not an active exclusive lock.</p>\n",
